Creation of Azure DevOps Account will be possible with two ways.

one is direct azure devops account creation with out creating the azure account
and other way is create azure account first and then from the resources in the azure we can create the azure devops account.

where can we find the common bridge for this activity is Default directory which will be created on the creation of azure account or on the creation of azure devops account

this default directory is called Azure Active Directory and generally AAD has an extension .onmicrosoft.com and the AAD will be formed as usergivenname.onmicrosoft.com



this outlook.com is an AAD 

in the AAD scope we have facility to re-direct the requests of in flow to the azure active directory to pass on the specified active directory.

we can customize the AAD name in to the required format.

AAD myname.onmicrosoft.com, to make it easy for some companies

myname.onmicrosoft.com , myname.ad

myname.onmicrosoft.om  myname.ad

with out an active directory, you cannot create any user account. GPMC Group Policy Management Console.

if you creating azure devops directly it is taking the email account is part of some AD, if it is microsoft user account , the host AD will be treated as AD but with limitations

if you are creating azure devops from Azure account, the existing AAD will be holding the control of user account but with some advantages where we will be discussing in the 
later classes.

Microsoft implemented some restrictions in 2020 related to integrations.
