Process to create an Azure DevOps Organization?

Open Azure DevOps Web Page and create an Organization

What do you need to create an ADO?

Azure Subscription

Don't We need Any Resource Group in Azure to create ADO?



How many ways are available to create the Azure DevOps Account? or Azure DevOps Organization initial one?

1) Create a Azure Account
2) Activate a free trial subscription
3) Create Azure DevOps Account

But, a basic rule is available in Azure, that if we want to create any resource in Azure, we should have created a Resource Group.

why the same rule is not being applied here?

explain the logic.

Azure DevOps comes under which scope of AS A Service?

guess it is a PAAS.

Even though it is a IAAS, PAAS,SAAS you must need a resource group to create the same in Azure.

so what is the logic here that is by passed to create the resource directly with out  Resource Group creation in Azure?


Any body observed that if we create Azure DevOps resource from the Azure Account what changes will be happened from Azure perspective?

is it a Security Group?
is it a Generalized Group?
is it a Resource Group?

Observations in Azure DevOps


When you create an organization in ADO, you are by default created with an Organization already.this is the change in Azure DevOps Account?

Observations in Azure when creating an Azure DevOps from Azure.

when you are creating Azure DevOps from Azure, it is getting binded with the Azure Active Directory which is already available in Azure Portal.

scenario 1 is creating azure devops account from azure portal
scenario 2 is creating azure devops account direcly with out creating azure portal.

To create an account in Azure DevOps, which account you have used?

1) Microsoft Account

2) Hotmail Account

3) Gmail Account

4) Outlook Account

Microsoft Account is the account that you are using to create a Azure DevOps.

when creating an Azure DevOps Account, you will be re-directed to Microsoft  to create an account called default directory to be associated with this Azure DevOps Account.

this default directory is called Azure Active Directory which will be created with user given microsoft account.

my microsoft account is manikanta@microsoft.com, manikanta@outlook.com or manikanta@gmail.com or manikanta@hotmail.com

then the default directory would be (which is called Azure Active Directory) manikanta.onmicrosoft.com

even though you create directly the Azure DevOps Account or create azure devops account by creating the Azure portal.

the azure devops account will be binded with Azure Active Directory generally which is created with the extn .onmicrosoftcom

it is getting linked to Azure, so i am saying it now it is a Azure Resource..

Azure DevOps is getting created with out creating a Resource Group in any way.WHY?

Azure DevOps is a resoure out of the scope of the IAAS, PAAS, SAAS but it is designed to be linked with Azure Active Directory along creation of the same.

What kind of Hierarchy in Azure to create the resources?? 

What kind of Hierarchy in Microsoft to create the resources??
